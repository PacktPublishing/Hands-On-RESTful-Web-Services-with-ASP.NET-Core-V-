# RESTful Web services with ASP.NET Core [Video]
This is the code repository for [RESTful Web services with ASP.NET Core [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/restful-web-services-aspnet-core-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788294638), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
	This video course will get you up-and-running with one of the most cutting-edge deep learning libraries: PyTorch. Written in Python, PyTorch is grabbing the attention of all data science professionals due to its ease of use over other libraries and its use of dynamic computation graphs. 

In this course, you will learn how to accomplish useful tasks using Convolutional Neural Networks to process spatial data such as images and using Recurrent Neural Networks to process sequential data such as texts. You will explore how you can make use of unlabeled data using Auto Encoders. REST is an architectural style that tackles the challenges of building scalable web services. In today's connected world, APIs have taken a central role on the web. APIs provide the fabric through which systems interact, and REST has become a common style for APIs. The depth, breadth, and ease of use of ASP.NET Coremake it a breeze for developers to work with it to build robust Web APIs. This video course takes you through designing RESTful web services and leverages the ASP.NET Core to implement these services.

Starting from the basic philosophy behind REST, you'll go through the first steps of designing and implementing an enterprise-grade RESTful web service. Taking a practical approach, each chapter provides code samples that you can apply to your own circumstances. It brings forth the power of the latest .NET Core release, working with ASP.NET Core. It then goes beyond the use of the framework to explore approaches to tackling resilience, security, and scalability concerns. 

You will start with the basics of REST and end with building a .NET Application for your RESTful web service.
